## Sprint 1 (App Version 1.0.1)


### Sprint Planning


### Srint Review

At first glance , the sprint went really well as almost everything that was planned got actually done , apart from some minor things that will be left for the next sprint. We were able to complete 10 user stories from the 12 that were initially planned. In retrospective , we could probably have finished all of them had we not had problemas while trying to test the current code with flutter_gherkin, tests which were rendered useless due to the dart limitations. It is also important to note that backend and testing in general is still pretty raw , as this will be the main focus in the next sprint.

To sum up, we agree that the sprint was well planned, well executed and that almost everything went according the plan.
