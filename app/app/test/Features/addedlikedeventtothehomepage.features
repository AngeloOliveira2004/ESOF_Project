Feature: Adding Liked Event Section to the Homepage
    As a developer
    I want to see a section on the homepage that displays my liked events

    Scenario: Displaying liked events on the homepage
        Given I am a logged-in user
        And I have liked some events
        When I visit another tab of the homepage
        Then I should see a section titled "Liked Events"
        And I should see a list of my liked events
