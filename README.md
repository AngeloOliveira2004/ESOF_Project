# _Help Buddies_ Development Report

Welcome to the documentation pages of the _Help Buddies_!

Initially, contributions are anticipated to originate solely from the founding team.

Don't hesitate to contact us for any changes you think are healthy for the development of the full extent of the app!

Best regards, 2LEIC04T4
